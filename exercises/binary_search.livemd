# Binary Search

## Setup

Ensure you run the `ea` command to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively,
you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:kino, github: "livebook-dev/kino", override: true},
  {:kino_lab, "~> 0.1.0-dev", github: "jonatanklosko/kino_lab"},
  {:vega_lite, "~> 0.1.3"},
  {:benchee, "~> 0.1"},
  {:ecto, "~> 3.7"},
  {:math, "~> 0.7.0"},
  {:utils, path: "utils"}
])
```

## Binary Search

Binary search is a type of sorting algorythm. It's part of a family of algorythms known as
**Divide and Conquer** algorithms.

Divide and conquer algorithms work by dividing the computer needs to do into parts.

Often, they split some group of elements into two parts, and then further split those halves into more two parts.

```mermaid
flowchart
a[Collection]
b1[Left Half]
b2[Right Half]
c1[Left Half]
c2[Left Half]
c3[Right Half]
c4[Left Half]

a --> b1
a --> b2
b1 --> c1
b1 --> c2
b2 --> c3
b2 --> c4
```

Let's say we want to find the number 5 in a sorted tuple, but we don't know it's index.
Binary search works by finding the mid point in the tuple, then checking if the mid point
is higher or lower than the desired number.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
a[1]
b[2]
c[3]
d[4]
e[5]
a --> b --> c --> d --> e
style c fill: yellow
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

We repeat this process of halving the number of elements to check, then
finding the mid point to halve it again until we find the desired element.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  d[4]
  e[5]

  d --> e
  style d fill: yellow
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

This leaves us with a single element left to check, and it matches our desired element.

You can watch this video on [binary search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3YID7liBug&ab_channel=HackerRank)
by HackerRank for an indepth guide to how that works.

Now you might wonder, how useful? It's a fair question. Not many programming jobs will require
vast knowledge of DSA (Domain Structures and Algorythms). Some jobs do use them for interview questions, however
realistically if you ever needed an algorythm, you could simply look up an implementation or use an existing library.

However, divide and conquer is useful for more than just finding elements in a collection. It's a mindset that
can save you time every single day.

For example, if your code is crashing or causing an error, you can [debug it using binary search](https://medium.com/codecastpublication/debugging-tools-and-techniques-binary-search-2da5bb4282c7).

In addition, presently if you wanted to find an element with an unknown index in a tuple, it could be challenging.
Instead, you might convert it to a list, but this is expensive, or at least it's $O(n)$ complexity at best.

```elixir
large_tuple = 1..10_000_000 |> Enum.to_list() |> List.to_tuple()
```

```elixir
Enum.find(Tuple.to_list(large_tuple), fn each -> each === 9_987_000 end)
```

Instead, binary search halves the number of elements to search with each run.
At first you have $n$ elements to search, then $n/2$ elements, then $n/4$ elements, and so on.
That means it has $O(log n)$ complexity.

```elixir
Utils.graph(:binary_search)
```

In the Elixir cell below, create a binary search algorythm that finds the index of a given value in a sorted tuple.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
tuple = 1..100 |> Enum.to_list() |> List.to_tuple()

Binary.search(tuple, 1)
0

Binary.search(tuple, 50)
49

Binary.search(tuple, 100)
99
```

```elixir
defmodule Binary do
  def search(tuple, element) do
  end
end

Binary.search(large_tuple, 9_987_000)
```
