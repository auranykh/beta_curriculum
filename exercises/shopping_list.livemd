# Shopping List

## Setup

Ensure you run the `ea` command to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively,
you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:kino, github: "livebook-dev/kino", override: true},
  {:kino_lab, "~> 0.1.0-dev", github: "jonatanklosko/kino_lab"},
  {:vega_lite, "~> 0.1.3"},
  {:benchee, "~> 0.1"},
  {:ecto, "~> 3.7"},
  {:math, "~> 0.7.0"},
  {:utils, path: "utils"}
])
```

## Text Shopping List

You are creating a shopping list app. Users have the ability to add items into their `shopping_cart`.
Each item is represented as a string.

In the Elixir cells below, use `++` and `--` to add the items show.

* Add `"grapes"`, `"walnuts"`, and `"apples"` to the `shopping_cart`
* Add `"blueberries"`, `"chocolate"`, and `"pizza"` to the `shopping_cart`.
* Remove `"grapes"` and `"walnuts"` from the `shopping_cart`
* Add three `"banana"`s to the `shopping_cart`

```elixir
shopping_cart = []
shopping_cart = shopping_cart ++ ["grapes", "walnuts", "apples"]
shopping_cart = shopping_cart ++ ["blueberries", "chocolate", "pizza"]
shopping_cart = shopping_cart -- ["grapes", "walnuts"]
shopping_cart = shopping_cart ++ ["banana", "banana", "banana"]
```

## Text Shopping List With Quantities

Users of your shopping list app have asked that they be able to include the quantity of each item
to make adding many items easier.

In the Elixir cell below, use a keyword list in the format `[item: quantity]` to add or remove
items from the `shopping_cart`

* Add `1` `"milk"` and `12` `"eggs"`
* Add `2` `"bars of butter"` and `10` `"candies"`
* Remove `2` `"bars of butter"`
* Remove `5` `"candies"` (Notice `5` and not `10`!)

```elixir
shopping_cart = []
shopping_cart = shopping_cart ++ [{"milk", 1}, {"eggs", 12}]
shopping_cart = shopping_cart ++ [{"bars of butter", 2}, {"candies", 10}]
shopping_cart = shopping_cart -- [{"bars of butter", 2}]
shopping_cart = shopping_cart
shopping_cart = shopping_cart ++ [{"candies", 5}]
```
