## FizzBuzz
In the Elixir cell below create a Module `FizzBuzz` with a function `run/1` which takes in a **range**.

Enumerate through the integers and return a new list where
- integers divisible by `3` are replaced with `fizz`
- integers divisible by `5` are replaced with `buzz`
- integers divisible by `5` are replaced with `fizzbuzz`
- integers not matching the above stay the same.
