# Ranges

## Section

**Ranges** are useful for representing an ascending or descending sequence of numbers, without needing
to manually type each number in a list.

For example, you could have a range from 1 to 10.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
1..10
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid

flowchart LR
  1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 4 --> 5 --> 6 --> 7 --> 8 --> 9 --> 10
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

or 5 to -5.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
5..-5
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  5 --> 4 --> 3 --> 2 --> 1 --> 0 --> -1 --> -2 --> -3 --> -4 --> -5
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

You can visualize a range as representing an ascending or descending list of integers.

On its own, it might not seem like much. But ranges will be incredibly useful with the `Enum` module.
You'll learn more about the `Enum` module in a future lesson. For now, it's enough
to understand the relationship between ranges and lists.

For example the range `1..5` equates to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` as a list.

To establish that relationship, you can use `Enum.to_list/1` to convert a range from the list.

```elixir
Enum.to_list(1..5)
```

Ranges can have a step. By default ranges have a step of `1`. That means that by default they
include each whole number in the range.

You can override the default step of the range using `//`:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
0..10//2
```

This creates a range from `0` to `10` with a step of `2`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
0 --> 2 --> 4 --> 6 --> 8 --> 10
```

That means the range `0..10//2` correlates to the list `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`

Here's the same range converted into a list to help you visualize it. Once again, you will
learn more about what `Enum.to_list` is in a future lesson.

```elixir
Enum.to_list(0..10//2)
```

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, Use `Enum.to_list` enter a range from `3` to `9` with a step of `3`. 
Replace `nil` with your answer.

```elixir

Ranges can have a step. By default ranges have a step of `1`. That means that by default they
include each whole number in the range.

You can override the default step of the range using `//`:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
0..10//2
```

This creates a range from `0` to `10` with a step of `2`.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
0 --> 2 --> 4 --> 6 --> 8 --> 10
```

That means the range `0..10//2` correlates to the list `[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`

Here's the same range converted into a list to help you visualize it. Once again, you will
