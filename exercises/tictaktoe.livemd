You're going to create a game of tic tak toe.

In tic tak toe, players take turns placing either an `X` or an `O` onto a 3 by 3 grid.

In the Elixir cell below,

* Create a `TicTakToe` module with a `play/3` function.

* `play/3` should accept a game board as the first parameter.

* `play/3` should accept a tuple for coordinates as the second parameter.
  The coordinates should match the following.

  ```elixir
  [
    [nil, nil, nil],
    [nil, nil, nil],
    [nil, nil, nil],
  ]
  ```

Which would represent the following tic tac toe board.
