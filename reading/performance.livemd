# Performance

## Setup

Ensure you run the `ea` command to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively,
you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:kino, github: "livebook-dev/kino", override: true},
  {:kino_lab, "~> 0.1.0-dev", github: "jonatanklosko/kino_lab"},
  {:vega_lite, "~> 0.1.3"},
  {:benchee, "~> 0.1"},
  {:ecto, "~> 3.7"},
  {:math, "~> 0.7.0"},

## Performance Concerns

Computers are composed of several parts. As programmers, we are primarily concerned about
 the **processor**, and the **memory**.

The processor determines the computer's speed when performing calculations.

Memory or **RAM** (random access memory) is measured in GB (Gigabytes) and is the amount of data
we can store during a calculation.

In software terms, this translates to the **speed** and **memory consumption** of our program. Generally
as you build software, those are your main performance concerns.

While computers are incredibly fast, they do have limits. Certain calculations take time to complete.
So, we need to be mindful of how to optimize our programs to operate efficiently.

For example, this statement may take some time.

```elixir
Enum.map(1..10_000_000, fn each -> each + 2 end)
```

## Big O Notation

As programmers, we are generally more concerned with how performance grows in our
program as data becomes larger.

We use **Big $$O$$ Notation** to communicate about how performance changes based on the size
of the data.

* **$$O(1)$$**: Constant Time
* **$$O(log (n))$$**: Logarithmic Time
* **$$O(n)$$**: Linear Time
* **$$O(n^2)$$**: Quadratic Time (Polonomial Time)
* **$$O(2^n)$$**: Exponential Time
* **$$O(n!)$$**: Factorial Time

```elixir
Utils.graph(:big_o_notation)
```

As you work with larger amounts of data, different big $O$ complexities grow faster than others.
See the graph below for a general ranking.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

![](images/big_o_notation_graph.png)

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

We should try to be aware of the performance costs and memory costs of both the
code that your write, and the built-in functionality you use, especially when working with large
amounts of data.

This will inspire both how you write code, and which data structures you choose for particular situations.

## Constant Complexity

Did you know that a [carrier pigeon can be faster than the internet](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-11325452)?
It's true, and it's related to the nature of constant growth.

Some operations take the same amount of time to execute no matter how much data is involved.
For example, a pigeon will travel some distance of kilometers in approximately the same time
every attempt. If you strap a USB stick to the pigeon, it can carry (within reason) any
amount of data to it's destination in a constant amount of time.

So a while it makes a great headline about slow internet speed, it's actually a
mathematical guarantee that for some size of data, a pigeon will be faster than the internet.

We can see the nature of how a constant travel time for some amount of data always intersects with the 
expected internet speed in the graph below.

```elixir
Utils.graph(:pigeon_beats_internet)
```

## Linear Complexity

Linear growth adds the same number of calculations for each element in the collection.
For example, reading a book would (assuming a consistent reading speed) be linear complexity.
If you take two minutes to read every page, you add an additional two minute for every page.

* With 1 page it takes 2 minute
* With 2 pages it takes 4 minutes
* With 3 pages it takes 6 minutes
* With 4 pages it takes 8 minutes

In programming terms, for each additional item added to the collection, the computer needs to
perform approximately the same number of additional calculations.

Plotted onto a graph you would expect that as we increase the number of elements, time grows in a constant line upward.

```elixir
Utils.graph(:linear_complexity)
```

## Polynomial Complexity

Rather than grow linearly, polynomial complexity grows to some power.
For example, nested loops typically result in polynomial complexity.

That's because for every element in the first enumerable, we enumerate through every element in
the second enumerable.

```mermaid
flowchart
A[1] --> B[1]
A[1] --> C[2]
A[1] --> D[3]

A1[2] --> B1[1]
A1[2] --> C1[2]
A1[2] --> D1[3]

A2[3] --> B2[1]
A2[3] --> C2[2]
A2[3] --> D2[3]
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Your Turn

Try changing `number` to `2`, `3`, and `4`. Notice how it creates more lists, with more
elements for each increase in number.

```elixir
number = 1

Enum.map(1..number, fn _ ->
  Enum.to_list(1..number)
end)
```

* With 1 element it creates 1 element
* With 2 elements it creates 4 elements
* With 3 elements it creates 9 elements
* With 4 elements it creates 12 elements

In other words, it creates $n^2$ elements. We can see how this grows in the following table.

```elixir
Utils.table(:n2)
```

If you nest a third enumeration it becomes $n^3$.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Your Turn

Try changing `number` to `2`, `3`, and `4`. Notice how it creates $n^3$ elements.

```elixir
number = 3

Enum.map(1..number, fn _ ->
  Enum.map(1..number, fn _ ->
    Enum.to_list(1..number)
  end)
end)
```

We can see how $n^3$ grows in the following table.

```elixir
Utils.table(:n3)
```

Plotted onto a graph, we can see that polynomial complexity results in an upward curve, and
the size of the power significantly increases the growth.

```elixir
Utils.graph(:polynomial_complexity)
```

## Exponential Complexity

In exponential growth, some constant grows by an additional power for each element added to the collection.

Let's take cracking a password as an example. We can assume a password can only be made from
integers `0` to `9`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
0---1---2---3---4---5---6---7---8---9
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

As the number of digits in the password increases, the number of combinations grows by a power
of `2`.

* With 1 digit it makes 10 attempts
* With 2 digits it makes 100 attempts
* With 3 digits it makes 1000 attempts
* With 4 digits it makes 10000 attempts

In other words, it executes $$10^n$$ attempts. Now often you'll see exponential complexity
represented as $2^n$  or $C^n$ where `2` or `C` represents some constant value. In the case of a password cracker, it would
be `10`.

```elixir
Utils.table(:exponential_growth)
```

```elixir
Utils.graph(:exponential_complexity)
```

## Factorial Complexity

Certain functions enumerate through every possible permutation of
the input. As you can imagine this is computationally expensive. for each element, the function needs to
enumerate through every remaining element.

For example, if you needed to calculate every permutation of a number, that would require
a factorial function.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart
  a[123]
  a --> b[1]
  a --> c[2]
  a --> d[3]
  b --> b1[2] --> 123
  b --> b2[3] --> 132
  c --> c1[1] --> 213
  c --> c2[3] --> 231
  d --> d1[1] --> 312
  d --> d2[2] --> 321
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Your Turn

Try adding elements to the `list` and notice how it creates $n!$ permutations of the list.

```elixir
defmodule Permutations do
  def of([]) do
    [[]]
  end

  def of(list) do
    for h <- list, t <- of(list -- [h]), do: [h | t]
  end
end

list = [1, 2, 3]
Permutations.of(list)
```

* With 1 element it creates 1 permutation
* With 2 elements it creates 2 permutations
* With 3 elements it creates 6 permutations
* With 4 elements it creates 24 permutations
* With 5 elements it creates 120 permutations

In other words, it creates $$n!$$ permutations. where $n!$ is a shorthand for

$n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1$

For example $5!$ is $5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1$.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

Factorial complexity grows incredibly fast, as you can see according to this graph and corresponding
data table.

```elixir
Utils.graph(:factorial_complexity)
```

```elixir
Utils.table(:factorial_complexity)
```

<!-- livebook:{"branch_parent_index":2} -->

## Measuring Performance

Big $O$ Notation allows us to reason about how processing speed and memory consuption will grow
given larger data sets for a calculation.

This is useful for theorizing about performance. In practice, it's best to test your assumptions.
By testing performance, we can avoid pre-optimizing code before it's necessary. We can also know which
pieces of code cost the most.

There's a wide variety of tools for measuring and monitoring performance. We'll focus on
benchmarking time and memory consumption for now.

### :timer.tc/1

Out of the box, Erlang provides a `:timer` library which contains a `tc/1` function to measure the time it takes to run a function.
It returns a `{time, result}` tuple.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
Function --> timer[:timer.tc/1] --> return["{timer, result}"]
```

```elixir
:timer.tc(fn -> 10000 ** 10000 - 10000 ** 10000 + 1 end)
```

The `time` returned is measured in microseconds.

`1000` microseconds equals `1` milisecond.
`1000` miliseconds equals `1` seconds.

So you can get the number of miliseconds the function takes to run by dividing the result by `1000`

```elixir
{time, _result} = :timer.tc(fn -> 10000 ** 10000 - 10000 ** 10000 + 1 end)
miliseconds = time / 1000
```

And the number of seconds by dividing once again by `1000`.

```elixir
seconds = miliseconds / 1000
```

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, use `:timer.tc/1` to measure an operation that takes more than 5 seconds.

```elixir

```

### Benchee

[Benchee](https://github.com/bencheeorg/benchee)
is a popular library for measuring performance and memory consumption.

External libraries need to be installed to use them.

We use [Mix](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.13/Mix.html) to install Benchee.

Mix is a build tool that provides tasks for creating, compiling, and testing Elixir projects, managing its dependencies, and more.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart LR
Benchee
D[Dependencies]
I[install/2]
Mix
Mix --> I
I --> D
D --> Benchee
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

You'll learn more about Mix in future lessons. For now, it's enough to be aware that you won't be able 
to use the Benchee library unless it's installed.

We've installed Benchee for you for this lesson, but don't be suprised if you try to use Benchee in
other lessons and it isn't installed.

We can use the `Benchee.run/2` function to measure the performance and memory consumption of some code.

```elixir
Benchee.run(%{
  "example test" => fn -> 10000 ** 10000 end
})
```

Above, the most imporant part of the output should look like the following, but with different numbers.

```
Name                   ips        average  deviation         median         99th %
example test        154.65        6.47 ms    ±26.50%        6.13 ms       13.17 ms

Memory usage statistics:

Name            Memory usage
example test           600 B
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

The Benchee documentation explains how to read the output:

> * average - average execution time/memory usage (the lower the better)
> * ips - iterations per second, aka how often can the given function be executed within one second (the higher the better - good for graphing), only for run times
> * deviation - standard deviation (how much do the results vary), given as a percentage of the average (raw absolute values also available)
> * median - when all measured values are sorted, this is the middle value. More stable than the average and somewhat more likely to be a typical value you see, for the most typical value see mode. (the lower the better)
> * 99th % - 99th percentile, 99% of all measured values are less than this - worst case performance-ish

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Using Benchee For Comparison

let's use Benchee to compare tuples and lists. Tuples are intended to be used as fixed-sized
containers that are fast for accessing. Lists are collections intended for dynamic sized containers that get modified.

Therefore, lists should be slow to access, and tuples should be fast to access. That's in theory, let's
verify our assumption and prove it to be true.

```elixir
size = 10000
large_list = Enum.to_list(0..size)
large_tuple = List.to_tuple(large_list)

Benchee.run(%{
  "list" => fn -> Enum.at(large_list, size) end,
  "tuple" => fn -> elem(large_tuple, size) end
})
```

Upon running the above, you should see an output similar to the following. You'll notice that
accessing a list was far slower!

```
Name            ips        average  deviation         median         99th %
tuple        1.09 M        0.92 μs  ±2806.65%        0.80 μs           2 μs
list       0.0324 M       30.89 μs    ±93.31%       28.90 μs       67.80 μs

Comparison: 
tuple        1.09 M
list       0.0324 M - 33.58x slower +29.97 μs
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Your Turn

Use Benchee to compare accessing the **first** element instead of the last element as we already did above.
You should notice the list is faster this time, or at least about the same speed. You'll learn why in a future lesson.

```elixir

If you take two minutes to read every page, you add an additional two minute for every page.

* With 1 page it takes 2 minute

Plotted onto a graph you would expect that as we increase the number of elements, time grows in a constant line upward.

```elixir

## Polynomial Complexity

Rather than grow linearly, polynomial complexity grows to some power.
For example, nested loops typically result in polynomial complexity.

That's because for every element in the first enumerable, we enumerate through every element in
the second enumerable.

### Your Turn

Try changing `number` to `2`, `3`, and `4`. Notice how it creates more lists, with more
elements for each increase in number.

```elixir

end)
```

* With 1 element it creates 1 element
* With 2 elements it creates 4 elements
* With 3 elements it creates 9 elements
* With 4 elements it creates 12 elements

In other words, it creates $n^2$ elements. We can see how this grows in the following table.

```elixir
Utils.table(:n2)
```

If you nest a third enumeration it becomes $n^3$.

```elixir
number = 3

Enum.map(1..number, fn _ ->
  Enum.map(1..number, fn _ ->
    Enum.to_list(1..number)

end)
```

We can see how $n^3$ grows in the following table.

```elixir
Utils.table(:n3)
```

Plotted onto a graph, we can see that polynomial complexity results in an upward curve, and
the size of the power significantly increases the growth.

```elixir
Utils.graph(:polynomial_complexity)

In exponential growth, some constant grows by an additional power for each element added to the collection.

Let's take cracking a password as an example. We can assume a password can only be made from
integers `0` to `9`.

As the number of digits in the password increases, the number of combinations grows by a power
of `2`.

* With 1 digit it makes 10 attempts
* With 2 digits it makes 100 attempts
* With 3 digits it makes 1000 attempts
* With 4 digits it makes 10000 attempts

In other words, it executes $$10^n$$ attempts. Now often you'll see exponential complexity
represented as $2^n$  or $C^n$ where `2` or `C` represents some constant value. In the case of a password cracker, it would
be `10`.

```elixir
Utils.table(:exponential_growth)
```

```elixir
Utils.graph(:exponential_complexity)
```

## Factorial Complexity

Certain functions enumerate through every possible permutation of
the input. As you can imagine this is computationally expensive. for each element, the function needs to
enumerate through every remaining element.

For example, if you needed to calculate every permutation of a number, that would require
a factorial function.

  b --> b1[2] --> 123
  b --> b2[3] --> 132
  c --> c1[1] --> 213
  c --> c2[3] --> 231
  d --> d1[1] --> 312
  d --> d2[2] --> 321
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Your Turn

Try adding elements to the `list` and notice how it creates $n!$ permutations of the list.

```elixir
defmodule Permutations do
  def of([]) do
    [[]]
  end

  def of(list) do
    for h <- list, t <- of(list -- [h]), do: [h | t]
  end
end

list = [1, 2, 3]
Permutations.of(list)
```

* With 1 element it creates 1 permutation
* With 2 elements it creates 2 permutations
* With 3 elements it creates 6 permutations
* With 4 elements it creates 24 permutations
* With 5 elements it creates 120 permutations

In other words, it creates $$n!$$ permutations. where $n!$ is a shorthand for

$n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1$

For example $5!$ is $5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1$.

Factorial complexity grows incredibly fast, as you can see according to this graph and corresponding
data table.

## Measuring Performance

Big $O$ Notation allows us to reason about how processing speed and memory consuption will grow
given larger data sets for a calculation.

This is useful for theorizing about performance. In practice, it's best to test your assumptions.
By testing performance, we can avoid pre-optimizing code before it's necessary. We can also know which
pieces of code cost the most.

There's a wide variety of tools for measuring and monitoring performance. We'll focus on
benchmarking time and memory consumption for now.

### :timer.tc/1

Out of the box, Erlang provides a `:timer` library which contains a `tc/1` function to measure the time it takes to run a function.
It returns a `{time, result}` tuple.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
Function --> timer[:timer.tc/1] --> return["{timer, result}"]
```

```elixir
:timer.tc(fn -> 10000 ** 10000 - 10000 ** 10000 + 1 end)
```

The `time` returned is measured in microseconds.

`1000` microseconds equals `1` millisecond.
`1000` milliseconds equals `1` seconds.

So you can get the number of milliseconds the function takes to run by dividing the result by `1000`

```elixir
{time, _result} = :timer.tc(fn -> 10000 ** 10000 - 10000 ** 10000 + 1 end)
milliseconds = time / 1000
```

And the number of seconds by dividing once again by `1000`.

```elixir
seconds = milliseconds / 1000
```

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, use `:timer.tc/1` to measure an operation that takes more than 5 seconds.

```elixir

```

### Benchee

[Benchee](https://github.com/bencheeorg/benchee)
is a popular library for measuring performance and memory consumption.

External libraries need to be installed to use them.

We use [Mix](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/1.13/Mix.html) to install Benchee.

Mix is a build tool that provides tasks for creating, compiling, and testing Elixir projects, managing its dependencies, and more.

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

```mermaid
flowchart LR
Benchee
D[Dependencies]
I[install/2]
Mix
Mix --> I
I --> D
D --> Benchee
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

You'll learn more about Mix in future lessons. For now, it's enough to be aware that you won't be able 
to use the Benchee library unless it's installed.

We've installed Benchee for you for this lesson, but don't be surprised if you try to use Benchee in
other lessons and it isn't installed.

We can use the `Benchee.run/2` function to measure the performance and memory consumption of some code.

```elixir
Benchee.run(%{
  "example test" => fn -> 10000 ** 10000 end
})
```

Above, the most imporant part of the output should look like the following, but with different numbers.

```
Name                   ips        average  deviation         median         99th %
example test        154.65        6.47 ms    ±26.50%        6.13 ms       13.17 ms

Memory usage statistics:

Name            Memory usage
example test           600 B
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

The Benchee documentation explains how to read the output:

> * average - average execution time/memory usage (the lower the better)
> * ips - iterations per second, aka how often can the given function be executed within one second (the higher the better - good for graphing), only for run times
> * deviation - standard deviation (how much do the results vary), given as a percentage of the average (raw absolute values also available)
> * median - when all measured values are sorted, this is the middle value. More stable than the average and somewhat more likely to be a typical value you see, for the most typical value see mode. (the lower the better)
> * 99th % - 99th percentile, 99% of all measured values are less than this - worst case performance-ish

### Using Benchee For Comparison

let's use Benchee to compare tuples and lists. Tuples are intended to be used as fixed-sized
containers that are fast for accessing. Lists are collections intended for dynamic sized containers that get modified.

Therefore, lists should be slow to access, and tuples should be fast to access. That's in theory, let's
verify our assumption and prove it to be true.

```elixir
size = 10000
large_list = Enum.to_list(0..size)
large_tuple = List.to_tuple(large_list)

Benchee.run(%{
  "list" => fn -> Enum.at(large_list, size) end,
  "tuple" => fn -> elem(large_tuple, size) end
})
```

Upon running the above, you should see an output similar to the following. You'll notice that
accessing a list was far slower!

```
Name            ips        average  deviation         median         99th %
tuple        1.09 M        0.92 μs  ±2806.65%        0.80 μs           2 μs
list       0.0324 M       30.89 μs    ±93.31%       28.90 μs       67.80 μs

Comparison: 
tuple        1.09 M
list       0.0324 M - 33.58x slower +29.97 μs
```

<!-- livebook:{"break_markdown":true} -->

### Your Turn

Use Benchee to compare accessing the **first** element instead of the last element as we already did above.
You should notice the list is faster this time, or at least about the same speed. You'll learn why in a future lesson.
