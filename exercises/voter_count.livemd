## Voter Count

You're creating a system for counting votes.

## Count Votes

In the Elixir cell below,

* Create a module `VoterCount` with a `count/2` function.
* `count/2` should accept a list of atoms that represent votes, and an atom.
* `count/2` should return an **integer** with the 
  number of votes in the first parameter list that match the second parameter atom

For example:

```elixir
VoterCount.count([:dogs, :dogs, :dogs, :cats], :dogs)
3

VoterCount.count([:dogs, :dogs, :dogs, :cats], :cats)
1

VoterCount.count([:dogs, :dogs, :dogs, :cats], :birds)
0
```

```elixir
