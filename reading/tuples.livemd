# Tuples

Tuples are fixed size containers for multiple elements. 
Like lists they can contain any data type.

```elixir
{}
{7}
{1, 2, 3}
{"example"}
{1, "pizza", 3, :success, false}
```

They are often used when you know the number of desired elements and their type.
For example, it's common in Elixir to use tuples to represent failure or success cases
with the associated error message or success value.

```elixir
{:success, "Well done!"}
{:error, "Too bad!"}
```

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, create a tuple with `:ok` as the first element, and `"got it!"` as
the second element.
