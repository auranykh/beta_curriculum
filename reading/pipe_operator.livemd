# Pipe Operator
## Lesson
To create more complex behavior, you'll often compose smaller functions together. Composing functions together reflects
nature of problem-solving where we take large problems and break them down into smaller ones.

To help compose functions together, Elixir provides the pipe `|>` operator.
That's the `|` symbol likely above your enter key, and the greater than `>` symbol side by side to make `|>`.

The pipe operator allows you to take the output of one function and pass it in as an argument
for the input of another function.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Input] --> B[Function1] 
  B --> C[Pipe]
  C --> D[Function2]
  D --> E[Output]
```

Why is this useful? Without the pipe operator you can wind up writing deeply nested function calls.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
four.(three.(two.(one.())))
```

But with the pipe operator, you can chain functions together.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
one.() |> two.() |> three.() |> four.()
```

If a function is called with multiple arguments, the function piped in will be the first argument.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
two(1, 2) # how to call two/2 by itself.

# How to use the pipe operator
# to call the two/2 with one/1 as the first argument.
one.() |> two.(2)
```

You can also pass in a value to a pipe.

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
1 |> two.()
```

The pipe operator doesn't change the behavior of a program. Instead, the pipe operator
exists as syntax sugar to improve the clarity of your code.

```elixir
add_grapes = fn shopping_list -> shopping_list ++ ["grapes"] end
add_pizza = fn shopping_list -> shopping_list ++ ["pizza"] end
add_blueberries = fn shopping_list -> shopping_list ++ ["blueberries"] end

[]
|> add_grapes.()
|> add_pizza.()
|> add_blueberries.()
|> add_pizza.()
|> add_blueberries.()

# vs the alternative
add_blueberries.(add_pizza.(add_blueberries.(add_pizza.(add_grapes.([])))))
