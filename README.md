# Beta Academy Curriculum
## QuickStart
1. install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_1-install-dependencies) or a compatable Elixir and Erlang version.
2. Install livebook main `mix escript.install github livebook-dev/livebook`.
3. Ensure the `.env` file is loaded in your environment with `source .env` from the `beta_curriculum` folder.
4. Run the project with `livebook server start.livemd`.

If you cannot see mermaid.js graphs, ensure your livebook version is correct.

## Class time

Class time will be broken into
1. **Assessment & Review**
2. **Introductory Lecture**
3. **Exercises**
4. **Reading & Support**

### Grading
Students will not receive a number or letter grade for this course. Due to the nature of the assignments,
this course will be completion-based and rely on the intrinsic motivation of learning and self-improvement rather than carrot and stick motivation.

For more on this see [Mark Rober's Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0&ab_channel=TEDxTalks).

## Student Goals
Students will be competent developers prepared to excel in the Elixir industry. They will have
a solid grasp of Elixir fundamentals, Elixir project development, Phoenix project development, LiveView, and OTP.
They will also have the researching and problem-solving skills necessary to expand their skill set and thrive
throughout their career. Students will be capable of delivering high-quality, well-tested features to a production complexity codebase.

## Writing Contribution Guide

- Code keywords such as `defimpl`, `defprotocol`, and `end` should use backticks (``).
- Important or new concepts should be in **bold** the first time you introduce them.
- Use title case without a period in headers.
- Code should be in an executable elixir cell unless it is pseudocode or it reduces the clarity of the lesson.
- Text should be run through [grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) to ensure correctness. The free features should be sufficient.
- Lessons should have a **Setup** section for any necessary dependencies.
- Each new major concept should be in its own section. Each section should strive to provide at least one student interaction portion, typically using the **Your Turn** heading.

# Beta Academy Curriculum
## QuickStart
1. install [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_1-install-dependencies) or a compatible Elixir and Erlang version.
2. Install livebook main `mix escript.install github livebook-dev/livebook`.
3. Ensure the `.env` file is loaded in your environment with `source .env` from the `beta_curriculum` folder.
4. Run the project with `livebook server start.livemd`.

If you cannot see mermaid.js graphs, ensure your livebook version is correct.
